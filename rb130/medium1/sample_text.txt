All the World's a Stage
By William Shakespeare 
As You Like It
Act 2, Scene 7

All the world's a stage, 
And all the men and women merely players: 
They have their exits and their entrances; 
And one man in his time plays many parts, 
His acts being seven ages. 

At first the infant, 
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms. 

And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel 
And shining morning face, creeping like snail 
Unwillingly to school. 

And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad 
Made to his mistress' eyebrow.
